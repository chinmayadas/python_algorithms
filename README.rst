Python Algorithms contains a collection of useful algorithms written in python. The algorithms include (but not limited to) topics such as seraching, sorting, graph, and string theory.

This project is inspired from the textbook `Algorithms, 4th Edition by Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne <http://amzn.to/13VNJi7>`_.
