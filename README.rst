Python Algorithms contains a collection of useful algorithms written in python. The algorithms include (but not limited to) topics such as seraching, sorting, graph, and string theory.

This project is inspired from the textbook Algorithms, 4th Edition by Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne and associated booksite http://algs4.cs.princeton.edu/home/. The goal of this book is summarized in the following excerpt from the booksite

	Our original goal for this book was to cover the 50 algorithms that every programmer should know. We use the word programmer to refer to anyone engaged in trying to accomplish something with the help of a computer, including scientists, engineers, and applications developers, not to mention college students in science, engineering, and computer science.
